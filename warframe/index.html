            <h2>Setting Up Your Mesa Build</h2>
            <p>In this final step of making the perfect Mesa build you will see how easy it is to have a broken frame</p>
            <div>
                <!-- This div in a box -->
                <p>Ready? Let's start!</p>
                <p>Easy-to-use-one-click-kill-Mesa is one of the strongest and easiest to farm builds in Warframe. If you enjoy killig a lot of enemies in no time, farming a lot of focus, going through missions like it's nothing, this build is right for you.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <!-- Recommended div, in red border -->
                    <h4>Recommended Build</h4>
                    <p>First of all if you want the maximum out of your Mesa build, forget about the normal one, and get a Prime version. The reason is not more energy or armor, it's beacuse it's easier to farm. Mesa parts drop from Mutalist Alad V Assassination on Eris, and trust me it's not fun at all to do that mission. He has an annoying mind control abilitiy that doesn't allow you to do the mission in under 2 minutes(<i>PRAISE THE SERGENT</i>). So getting her parts from relics and/or buying her for platinum is much easier. Her whole set costs around 75 platinum, what's extremly cheap, so selling a couple veiled Riven Mods can easily solve that problem.</p>
                    <p>And there you go, a Mesa Prime with an installed Orokin Reactor for 75 platinum, easy and time efficient.</p>

                    <!-- Not Recommended -->
                    <h4>Not Recommended - farming Mesa parts</h4>
                    <p>If you haven't noticed there is no point of doing this, you will just hate yourself and everyone else. <i>Just play the Prime version.</i></p>

            <p>Every veteran player would give the same answer to the question: "What is the most important thing to do in Warframe?". Ofcourse the answer is to look better then everyone else. The satisfaction of looking badass and showing other into their face that you look better is just priceless. We will show you how you can make your frame look awesome and astonishing.</p>
